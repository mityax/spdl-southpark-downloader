[install-unix]: x
## Installation on Unix
The only system requirement to download episodes is a working ffmpeg binary.
On most ubuntu-like systems a simple

```sudo apt install ffmpeg```

should be enough, if ffmpeg is not installed already. To install ffmpeg on other platforms, visit their [download site](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
If you use spdl.py as a python library and do not want to use the built-in download function, you don't event need ffmpeg.
